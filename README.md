# NoImNotAHumanCheatEngineTable
easy cheat for NINAH for detecting enemies

Run the game (it doesnt work in main manu). Before use activate Mono feature after opening NoImNotAHuman.exe in cheatengine: CheatEngine -> Mono -> Activate mono features. Then load this table. When you are in dialogue with someone, press on record and in console will be wrote is them imposter or not, also is lists id's of imposters in your house. Deactivate and Activate again for new dialogue.

Also, it doesnt work if its second run and e.g, so, if u ruined run, restart NINAH and activate cheat with instructions before.
